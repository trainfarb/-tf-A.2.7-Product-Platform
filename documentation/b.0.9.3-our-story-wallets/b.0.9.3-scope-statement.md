# B.0.9.3 Scope Statement

### Project Goals

We want to create a Digital Twin Wallet for oS3’s B.0.9.3. This will be a helpful tool for Micro-Enterprises to visualise and understand the Open Source Executives they can use. The Digital Twin Wallet will be like a content wallet or blog, with 3D models that show how Open Source Teams can benefit Micro-Enterprises. We want to teach Micro-Enterprises and High School Students about the advantages of Platform Ecosystems, which can give them more clarity, focus, productivity, and creativity. It’s a new and exciting concept, so we think Digital Twin Wallets will be a great way to introduce these ideas and help people gain agency over their communities.

### Project Objectives

* Create a Digital Twin Wallet that visually represents Open Source Executives for Micro-Enterprises.
* Onboard Open Source Executives by making 3D models that show their impact.
* Educate Micro-Enterprises and High School Students about Platform Ecosystems and their benefits.

### Project Requirements

We will create digital twins using different software, starting with user-friendly options like Spline and then moving on to more advanced tools like Blender Archviz and BlenderBIM, which is the industry standard. For the wallets, we will start with Substack and then migrate to Web5, which works with Bitcoin and Decentralized platforms.

### Project Scope Description

This project includes creating the Digital Twin Wallet documentation, choosing the right software, and making it accessible to Micro-Enterprises and High School Students.

### Project Exclusions

We won't be developing the Open Source Executives themselves or integrating the Digital Twin Wallet into existing operations. We're also not focusing on marketing or promotion beyond education.

### Project Constraints

* We will only use open-source software and tools.
* We will follow the stages mentioned, starting simple and gradually increasing complexity.
* We will work within a set timeframe and budget (to be decided).

### Project Assumptions

* Micro-Enterprises and High School Students are keen to learn about Platform Ecosystems and Open Source Executives.
* The software we choose will be effective for creating the Digital Twin Wallet and wallets.
* Our project team has the skills needed to deliver high-quality results.

### Project Deliverables

* Digital Twin Wallet documentation.
* 3D models of Open Source Executives.
* Wallets made with Substack and Web5.
* Educational resources for Micro-Enterprises and High School Students.
