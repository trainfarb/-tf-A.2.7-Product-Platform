# B.0.9.3 Scope Statement

\## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to build the B.0.9.3 Digital Twin Wallet documentation for oS3. This documentation will assist Micro-Enterprises in creating a Digital Twin Wallet for the Open Source Chief Language Officer. The Digital Twin Wallet provides a visual representation of the Open Source Executives integrated into a Micro-Enterprise's operations. This tool will aid in onboarding Open Source Executives by illustrating how different Open Source Teams support Micro-Enterprises. By learning about the benefits of Platform Ecosystems, Micro-Enterprises will gain clarity, focus, productivity, and creativity. The Digital Twin Wallet will also serve as an educational tool for High School Students, teaching them how to leverage platform ecosystems and open source executives to gain agency over their communities.

\## Project Objectives

1\. Develop comprehensive documentation for the Digital Twin Wallet, covering all aspects of its creation and usage.

2\. Create a step-by-step guide for Micro-Enterprises to build their Digital Twin Wallets using user-friendly tools.

3\. Develop educational content to explain the benefits of Platform Ecosystems and how they can enhance business operations.

4\. Ensure the documentation is accessible and understandable for both Micro-Enterprises and High School Students.

5\. Incorporate feedback from initial users to continuously improve the documentation.

\## Project Requirements

1\. Develop digital twins in stages with increasing levels of complexity:

&#x20;   \- Start with Spline for its user-friendly interface.

&#x20;   \- Progress to Blender Archviz for high-quality visualizations.

&#x20;   \- Ultimately, utilize BlenderBIM for industry-standard IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) integration.

2\. Create wallets in stages with increasing levels of complexity:

&#x20;   \- Begin with Substack as the initial platform for the wallet.

&#x20;   \- Migrate to a Web5 Wallet for integration with Bitcoin and decentralized platforms.

3\. Ensure the documentation includes detailed instructions, visuals, and examples.

\## Project Scope Description

The scope of this project includes the development of detailed documentation for the creation and use of the B.0.9.3 Digital Twin Wallet. This documentation will guide Micro-Enterprises through the process of building their Digital Twin Wallets, starting with basic tools and progressing to more advanced platforms. The scope also includes the creation of educational materials to help users understand the benefits of Platform Ecosystems and how to integrate Open Source Executives into their operations. Additionally, the project will focus on making the documentation accessible to High School Students to promote early understanding of these concepts.

\## Project Exclusions

1\. Development of the actual Digital Twin Wallet software.

2\. Customization of the Digital Twin Wallet for individual Micro-Enterprises.

3\. Training sessions or workshops beyond the provided documentation.

4\. Ongoing support and maintenance of the Digital Twin Wallets created by users.

\## Project Constraints

1\. Limited budget for documentation development and design.

2\. Tight deadlines to align with the release schedule of oS3 B.0.9.3.

3\. Availability of subject matter experts for input and review.

4\. Ensuring compatibility with various platforms and tools used by Micro-Enterprises.

\## Project Assumptions

1\. Users have basic technical knowledge and can follow detailed instructions.

2\. Sufficient resources (time, budget, and personnel) are available to complete the documentation.

3\. The tools and platforms chosen (Spline, Blender Archviz, BlenderBIM, Substack, Web5) will remain stable and accessible throughout the project.

4\. Initial feedback from users will be provided in a timely manner for iterative improvements.

\## Project Deliverables

1\. Comprehensive Digital Twin Wallet documentation, including:

&#x20;   \- Step-by-step guides for different stages of wallet creation.

&#x20;   \- Visual aids and examples for clarity.

&#x20;   \- Educational content on Platform Ecosystems.

2\. A feedback mechanism for users to provide input on the documentation.

3\. Periodic updates to the documentation based on user feedback and new developments in the tools and platforms used.

4\. Finalized documentation ready for release in alignment with oS3 B.0.9.3 launch.
