NEED\


* What problem are you solving?
* Just created a cohort based FigJam Workshop for Investment Memos and know it will be confusing and time consuming to create a new structure for each of the 28 steps.&#x20;
  * Clarity Problem: I have no clarity on what the next day's workshop structure will be.&#x20;
  * Focus Problem: This makes it hard for me to focus on creating effective prompts that will help people create strong responses
  * Productivity Problem: This forces me to spend more time on creating a new structure and new set of questions each time which reduces my productivity and reduces the amount of money I can earn related to the amount of work I put in
  * Creativity Problem: When all of my creative energy goes into the FigJam Workshop Structure, I have less time to be creative with how we tell people about the value of using the tool.

* How do you solve the problem?
* Clarity Solution: Model each FigJam Workshop page after the frameWorkbook design that I improve from 2024.05.07 to 2024.06.03
  * Focus Solution: trainfarb (Prompt Engineer) designs the FigJam Workshop page in Figma. Helps us focus on a set structure so we only get to ask 8 questions based on AI Problem Formulation that become guidelines for prompts that help create AI Assistants will create documentation in the next step
  * Productivity Solution: hu3agency (Technical Writer) brings the Figma Designs into FigJam and use the AI Assistant to create clear documentation that guide people on how to print out their worksheet, populate their responses, and then migrate their responses to their section in the FigJam Workshop
  * Creativity Solution: ourStory (3D Modeler) transforms the documentation into a Digital Twin associated with the part of the city block that the question represents. This becomes the visual for the content that gets shared on social media as a beatDrop (blog) in different parts.

* How does the solution change behavior?
* Clarity Benefit: Îœicro-Enterprises have a clear 8-step process for each step of their investment memo that makes it much easier for them to complete
  * Focus Benefit: With a clearer process that they don't have to think about, they can focus on what's most important: answering the questions that help them form their investment memo
  * Productivity Benefit: With a clearer process that allows them to focus, their productivity will go up so they can spend less time working with a consultant and they'll be able to have a lot more trust and confidence in the knowledge base/ documentation/ internal developer portal/ internal executive portal
  * Creativity Benefit: With a clearer process that allows micro-enterprises to use the documentation more, it frees up ourStory to spend the majority of the time on promoting the benefits of the process so we can bring in more micro-enterprises and small businesses into the ecosystem
