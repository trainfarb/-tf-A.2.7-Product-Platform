# Problem Decomposition
## Initial State
B.9.0: Education Institutions don’t teach people how to create platforms and MSMEs don’t have the resources to hire all of the executives needed.
- Unfocused: Fragmented approach to problems. Ex. People need investment memos to create a website, but once it’s done, it can’t be easily translated into other parts of the project.
- Unproductive: People don’t collaborate. Too much is closed source, so we’re always reinventing the wheel. Ex. People spend so much time and money on creating websites that they don’t even use. Websites to correlate to their day to day business. Waste of energy.
- Uncreative: People don’t know how to clearly tell the story of the value they provide. Ex. People waste time on social media, but many can’t clearly say how something their sharing tangibly adds value to a part of their business.

## Actions
B.9.0 Internal Developer Training Platform: Open Source Executive training platform that teaches people/MSMEs how to create and manage platform ecosystems.
- Focused: Teach how the Onboarding API makes Investment Memos more valuable by turning them into agendas/action items that each platform team can act on.
- Productive: Teach how the Onboarding API translates investment memo directly into a website that acts as the face of your platform’s operating system. Onboarding API allows people to create a well designed website in a single day instead of a month or more.
- Creative: Teach how the Onboarding API translates investment memo into a collaborative content strategy that shares your value in an intentional way to grow a more supportive and engaged network.
