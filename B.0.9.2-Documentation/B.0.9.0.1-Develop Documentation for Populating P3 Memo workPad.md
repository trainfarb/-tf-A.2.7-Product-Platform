#### Purpose
`What is the purpose of your platform and what is your current focus?`  
Make Light of It enables Closeted Creatives to participate in the future of Enjoying Their Reality. Today, we're focused on A.2.7.0.1 Populating our P3 Memo Workpad and cancelling our GoDaddy Account to prepare for our Framer website.

#### Problem
`What is the problem associated with today's meeting?`  
We're focused on two problems today. 1. It's hard for people who are passionate about an idea to organize it in a way that's easy for others to understand which makes it hard for them to find partners who can help them make it a reality. 2. It's expensive for creatives to create a website that expresses their ideas and something as simple as web hosting can deter people from justifying pursuing what they want

#### Solution
`How will this meeting work towards a solution?`  
Today, we're using documentation created from our P3 Ecosystem, B.0.9.0.1, to populate the workPad that we created yesterday to help us express our ideas more clearly.

Also, we're working through the steps to get a refund from GoDaddy so we can save money and prepare for launching our website later this month with Framer.

#### Market
`What risks will this solution help mitigate?`  
If people can't express their ideas, they're likely to do everything themselves, get burnt out, and abandon pursuing what they want because it doesn't feel realistic.

If people get distracted by choosing a website domain, hosting provider, etc, they risk not pursuing what they want to do because it's not within their budget or because they don't have the time or energy to invest in understanding how to create and manage a website.

#### Product
`What will be the final result that represents a successful meeting outcome?`  
Make Light of It complete a 1-day case study to summarize the Situation, Complication, and Resolution associated with today's work. This will be saved to Make Light of It's GitHub Repository, GitHub Project, and will ultimately be streamed to the DEG Entreprises GitHub Profile to be included in the ecosystem's daily debrief.

#### Distribution
`How will you share the successful meeting outcome with the open source community?`  
We will share a brief essay expressing the value provided by today's work to hu3agency's Substack.
